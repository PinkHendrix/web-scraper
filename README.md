This is a testing project for web scraping learnt from Ania Kubow [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3lqUHeZs_0&t=1142s)

Created with npm, cheerio, axios, node and Express.

Many thanks!

Because we are searching for titles (text) and urls (href), you need to find a 'class' name that contains both of these otherwise it will fail.

Use the search elements in your Browser's Dev Tools for this.
